            <h1> Primary School </h1>
            <p> Like many others, I enrolled into a nearby Primary School in their neighbourhood. </p>
            <p> The school I enrolled into is Compassvale Primary School, and I went through all 6 years of formal Primary School education. </p>
            <p> It was both a blissful and also a stressful place to be in, due to many opportunities to interact with classmates while also keeping up with studies. </p>
            <p> I also joined a Soccer Club in my 3rd year of Primary School, and I remember how gruelling the physical training were because of the lack of consistent fitness activities in that time. </p>
            <p> While I did not fully excel in Primary School, I was also not doing too badly while picking up subjects in Primary School. </p>
            <p> At the end of Primary School, I accumulated a score of 163 for my PSLE year end examination and landed myself on a Normal Academic stream in Secondary School. </p>

            <h1> Secondary School </h1>
            <p> After Primary School, I enrolled into Sengkang Secondary School for my high school studies in 2018. </p>
            <p> During Secondary School, I have made many long-lasting friendships and accquaintances as a Normal Academic student. It was also this time I joined the school's media club, which is in-charge of the school's performances and media productions.  </p>
            <p> I had a lot of fun in the first few years of my youth, and also came to learn many meaningful life lessons there. </p>
            <p> This was also the time where I developed my interests, beliefs, values and identity as a person. This is especially so in the 3rd year of Secondary School, where responsibilities are became more serious and life-changing. </p>
            <p> At last, after years of studying and hardwork, I was able to enter into the Polytechnic Foundation Programme. This programme meant that I could enter into a Polytechnic early and reserve a spot in the course of my choosing. </p>
