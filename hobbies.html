            <h1> Apex Predator </h1>
            <p>
              Apex Predator is a single-player, 2D Action RPG game where players have a choice to either help the village by killing animals or 
              choose to follow the tribe by capturing animals and prevent endangered animals from going extinct.
            </p>
            <p>
              The game is created entirely in Unity Engine 2022, using C# Language and its built-in engine features.
              It is developed by a group of 4 members including me under a two-week schedule. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I was in-charge of developing the inventory system, Artificial Intelligence (AI) enemies, and Quest system. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In this game, players can choose two routes to complete the game: the village quest route or the tribal quest route.
              The village quest route requires players to continously kill animals, while the tribe quest route encourages players to protect
              endangered animals by capturing them. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Both routes would result in an ending of the game when the environment is either irreparably damaged forever or the environment is 
              protected and flourished.
